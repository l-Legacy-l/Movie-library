# Movies library

This project was carried out as part of the C# and WPF programming course at the Haute école en Hainaut.

The program will allow you to add several movies to a list according to certain parameters and it will also allow you to save or load one or more movie libraries 
It also has some additional features to improve the use of the program, such as image search on google or Allociné to retrieve a synopsis.
